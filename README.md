## Skills (Knowledge)

Skills are loaded by agents to provide context. You can also load them directly.

| Skill | What It Contains |
|-------|------------------|
| **brand-voice** | Voice adjectives, design pillars, content pillars, product voice rules |
| **style-guide** | Grammar, punctuation, mechanics, AI communication patterns |
| **audience-personas** | Three personas (Families, Professionals, HNW) with pain points and messaging |
| **product-knowledge** | What MyVault does, three agents, features, V1 scope, safe claims |

---

## Agents

Agents execute tasks using the knowledge from skills.

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **topic-researcher** | Gathers statistics, trends, data with source quality evaluation |
| **content-researcher** | Maps content landscape, finds gaps, analyzes competitor positioning |
| **writer** | Creates content with 9 signature moves and 4-phase protocol |
| **style-editor** | Reviews content with 8-phase protocol for brand compliance |

## MyVault Voice (Quick Reference)

### Do
- "MyVault found 12 duplicates"
- "Your photos stay private"
- "From scattered to sorted—automatically"

### Don't
- "I found 12 duplicates for you!"
- "Protect yourself from hackers"
- "Military-grade encryption"

### Product Voice Rule
MyVault is a **tool**, not a personality. Never "I" — always "MyVault" or "Your [Agent Name]."

*Private by design. Intelligent by nature.*
