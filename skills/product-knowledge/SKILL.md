# MyVault Product Knowledge

What writers need to know to describe MyVault accurately.

## What MyVault Is NOT

Use these to avoid overpromising:

| It's NOT | Clarification |
|----------|---------------|
| Just cloud storage | Provides intelligence and insights, not just storage space |
| A password manager | Focuses on documents and data, not credentials |
| Enterprise software | Consumer-focused, family-centered design |
| A replacement for specialists | Augments (doesn't replace) financial advisors, insurance agents, estate planners |
| A data mining platform | User maintains complete control; data never sold or shared |

## Differentiators

Use these when positioning MyVault:

### vs. Cloud Storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
> "MyVault adds an AI layer on top of your existing files. Find documents by content, not just filename. Get insights, not just storage."

### vs. Password Managers
> "Password managers handle credentials. MyVault handles the documents and data that matter—with AI-powered insights."

### vs. Financial Apps (Mint)
> "Financial apps track cash flow. MyVault manages the underlying documents—linking that insurance payment to your actual policy, coverage details, and renewal date."

### vs. Legacy Planning Tools
> "Legacy tools get used once and forgotten. MyVault is useful every day—and keeps your estate planning current automatically."

### The Unique Combination
