# MyVault Style Guide

Grammar, mechanics, and formatting rules for consistent, polished written content.

*Based on AP Stylebook with MyVault-specific adaptations.*

---

## Headlines & Headings

| Type | Case | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Headlines | Sentence case | "Your memories, finally organized" |
| Subheadings | Sentence case | "How it works" |
| Product features | Sentence case | "Smart duplicate detection" |
| Agent names | Title case | "Insurance Agent" |

**Note:** MyVault uses sentence case throughout for warmth and approachability. Title case feels too formal for our voice.

**Sentence Case Rules:**
- Capitalize first word and proper nouns only
- "Private by design" not "Private By Design"
- "How MyVault works" not "How MyVault Works"

**Exceptions:**
- Agent names are title case: "Insurance Agent," "Finance Agent," "Asset Agent"
- "MyVault" is always one word with capital M and V

---

## Numbers

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Spell out one through nine | "three albums" |
| Numerals for 10+ | "47 photos" |
| Large numbers for impact | "47,000 photos" |
| Measurements: numerals | "2GB storage" |
| Percentages | "7 percent" (numeral + spelled word) |
| Time | "in 3 seconds" (numerals for speed/efficiency) |
| Money | "$9/month" or "$99/year" |
| Confidence levels | "87% confident" (numerals for precision) |

**Exception:** Use numerals when showing product value or efficiency.
- "Organized 2,347 photos in 3 minutes"
- "Found 47 duplicates"
- "Saved $247 on insurance"

---

## Punctuation

### Em Dashes (—)
- No spaces around them—like this
- Use sparingly; one per paragraph maximum
- Good for emphasis or clarification

### Ellipsis (...)
- Avoid in marketing copy (creates uncertainty)
- Acceptable in conversational contexts: "47,000 photos. Zero organization. Sound familiar?"

### Oxford Comma
- Always use it: "photos, videos, and documents"

### Periods
- Use in UI for complete sentences
- Skip for labels and button text

### Exclamation Points
- Use rarely—they undercut our confident tone
- Never more than one per page/screen
- Never in security messaging
- Never in AI/agent communications

### Question Marks
- Good for headlines that create recognition
- "Sound familiar?" works
- Avoid rhetorical questions that feel manipulative

---

## Product References

### MyVault (the product)
- Always capitalized: "MyVault"
- Never: "My Vault," "myVault," "Myvault"
- Singular: "MyVault is..." not "MyVault are..."

### Feature Names
- Sentence case, no trademark symbols in copy
- "Smart organization" not "Smart Organization™"
- "Duplicate detection" not "Duplicate Detection"

### Agent Names
- Title case: "Insurance Agent," "Finance Agent," "Asset Agent"
- Use "the" when referencing: "the Insurance Agent found..."
- Possessive: "your Insurance Agent" (lowercase "your")

### Technical Terms

| Term | Usage |
|------|-------|
| vault | Lowercase when general: "your vault" |
| Vault | Capitalize when naming feature: "Open Vault" |
| Private by design | Lowercase (tagline style) |
| Intelligent by nature | Lowercase (tagline continuation) |
| end-to-end encryption | Lowercase, hyphenated |
| Ask MyVault | Title case (feature name) |

---

## AI Communication Style

### Confidence Indicators

When MyVault communicates uncertainty, use these patterns:

| Confidence | Language Pattern | Example |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| High | Direct statement | "MyVault found 12 duplicates." |
| Medium | "appears to" / "likely" | "These appear to be from the same event." |
| Low | "might be" / "could be" | "This might be an insurance document." |
| Uncertain | "needs your help" | "MyVault needs your help identifying this." |

### Explaining AI Decisions

**Do:** Explain in simple terms
> "Grouped by date and location from your photo data."

**Don't:** Use technical jargon
> "Clustered using temporal and geospatial metadata analysis."

### Action Language for Agents

| Agent | Action Verbs |
|-------|--------------|
| Insurance Agent | found, analyzed, compared, noticed, tracked |
| Finance Agent | organized, spotted, flagged, summarized, tracked |
| Asset Agent | remembered, tracked, scheduled, cataloged, found |

**Example:**
> "Your Insurance Agent compared your current policy with three alternatives and found potential savings of $180/year."

---

## UI Copy

### Buttons
- Sentence case: "Get started"
- Action verbs: "Create album," "Share with family"
- Brief: 1-3 words when possible

### Labels
- Sentence case: "Photo library"
- No punctuation

### Confirmations
- Brief, clear: "Album created"
- No celebration: "Album created" not "Awesome! Album created!"
- For AI actions, brief explanation welcome: "Album created—47 photos grouped by date"

### Errors
- Helpful, not apologetic
- "Couldn't upload. Check your connection." not "Oops! Something went wrong!"
- Never blame the user

### Empty States
- Encouraging, not cute
- "No albums yet. Create one?" not "It's lonely in here!"

### Agent Notifications
- Lead with finding: "Found: potential duplicate subscription"
- Include source: "From your uploaded statements"
- Clear action: "Review now" or "Dismiss"

---

## Emphasis

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| *Italics* for emphasis | **Bold** for emphasis |
| *Italics* for titles | ALL CAPS for emphasis |

**Italicize:**
- Publication titles: *The New York Times*
- Emphasis (sparingly): "Your photos *never* leave your device"

**Bold:**
- Only for UI labels or scannable lists
- Never for emphasis in body copy

---

## Contractions

Use them—they're warmer.

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "We're" | "We are" |
| "You'll" | "You will" |
| "Don't" | "Do not" |
| "It's" | "It is" |
| "MyVault's" | "MyVault is" (when possessive or contraction fits) |

**Exception:** Formal documents (terms of service, privacy policy) may use full forms.

---

## Names & References

### People
- "You" is primary
- "Your family" for family contexts
- Avoid "users" in customer-facing copy

### Company References
- "MyVault" (the product/company)
- "We" only in direct company communications
- "The MyVault team" for human touch

### Competitor References
- Never name competitors directly
- "Big tech" or "other services" when necessary
- Focus on what we do, not what others don't

### Agent References
- Always "the [Agent Name]" or "your [Agent Name]"
- Never "our AI" or "the algorithm"
- Treat agents as specialized tools, not personalities

---

## Links

- Hyperlink 2-4 words
- Descriptive: "Learn how encryption works" not "Click here"
- Never "Click here" or "Read more"

---

## Lists

### Bulleted Lists
- Use when order doesn't matter
- Parallel structure (all start same way)
- No punctuation unless complete sentences

### Numbered Lists
- Use when order matters
- Use for steps: "1. Open MyVault. 2. Select photos..."

---

## Dates & Times

| Dates | "March 15, 2024" |
| Relative time | "2 hours ago" |
| Informal | "yesterday," "last week" |
| Deadlines | "Renews March 15" (no comma for short form) |

---

## Abbreviations

### Spell Out First Use
- "End-to-end encryption (E2EE)" if technical audience

### Avoid

- "E2EE," "AES-256" unless necessary

---

## Words to Cut

Remove these unless absolutely necessary:

| Word | Why |
|------|-----|
| Actually | Usually filler |
| Very | Find stronger word |
| Just | Minimizes value |
| Really | Cut or replace |
| Simply | Condescending |
| Easily | Everyone claims it |
| Quickly | Show, don't tell |
| Basically | Filler |
| Literally | Often misused |

---

## Sentence Starters to Avoid

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "We believe..." | Hedging—just say it |
| "In today's world..." | Generic |
| "As you know..." | Presumptuous |
| "It goes without saying..." | Then don't say it |
| "Simply put..." | Condescending |
| "Our AI..." | Makes it about us, not them |

---

## Voice Rules

### Active Voice (Do This)
> "MyVault organizes your photos automatically."

### Passive Voice (Avoid)
> "Your photos are organized automatically by MyVault."

### Product as Subject (Do This)
> "MyVault found 12 duplicates."
> "The Insurance Agent analyzed your policies."

### AI as Subject (Never)
> "I found 12 duplicates for you."
> "I analyzed your policies."
