# MyVault Audience Personas

Three audiences. Equal priority. Same voice, different entry points.

---

## The Shared Need

All three audiences share a common thread:

> **Intelligent organization + privacy + control over their digital life.**

They arrive through different doors, but they want the same thing: a digital life that works for them, stays private, and doesn't require constant maintenance.

| What They Share | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Distrust of big tech | They've read the privacy policies |
| Value privacy | Different reasons, same outcome |
| Want things to "just work" | No time for manual organization |
| Appreciate honesty over hype | Tired of marketing speak |
| Respond to confidence, not fear | Security that reassures |
| Time-constrained | Organization is a means, not an end |

**The MyVault voice works for all three.** Adjust emphasis, not tone.

---

## Audience 1: Tech-Forward Families

**Who:** Parents (35-55), $100K-$300K+ income, college-educated, multiple devices, comfortable with tech but overwhelmed by volume.

**Entry point:** Family protection, photo chaos, emergency preparedness

**The moment:**
> "47,000 photos. Files everywhere. What if something happens to me—can my spouse find what they need?"

### Pain Points

| Pain | Content Hook |
|------|--------------|
| Digital document chaos | Files scattered across devices, cloud, email |
| Emergency anxiety | "What if something happens? Can my family find everything?" |
| Subscription sprawl | Lost track of what they're paying for |
| Insurance uncertainty | Not sure if coverage is adequate, forget renewals |
| Time pressure | No time to organize, always in catch-up mode |
| Photo chaos | Can't find specific memories when they want them |

### Motivations

- Protect family's digital life and financial security
- Be prepared for emergencies (without being morbid)
- Reduce daily friction and mental overhead
- Optimize family finances
- Leave an organized legacy for children

### Messaging That Works

- "Your family's important documents, organized and protected"
- "In an emergency, your spouse can find everything they need"
- "MyVault found 5 subscriptions you forgot about"
- "Never miss an insurance renewal again"
- "From scattered to sorted—automatically"

### Writing for Families

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Lead with chaos → calm | Lead with technical features |
| Show family scenarios | Use abstract examples |
| Emphasize "automatic" | Require effort from them |
| Address emergency preparedness | Make it morbid |
| Privacy as family protection | Privacy as paranoia |

**Technical depth:** Low to medium. Benefits, not mechanisms.

---

## Audience 2: Security-Conscious Professionals

**Who:** Professionals (28-50), tech/finance/legal/healthcare, $75K-$200K, single or DINK, power users of privacy tools (VPNs, password managers, ProtonMail).

**Entry point:** Privacy architecture, data sovereignty, zero-trust

**The moment:**
> "I read the privacy policy. I know what 'free' really costs. And I can't verify how my data is handled."

### Pain Points

| Pain | Content Hook |
|------|--------------|
| Data scattered across services | No single source of truth |
| Privacy erosion | Existing tools mine data for ads |
| Lack of control | Can't verify how data is handled |
| Retrieval friction | Know they have a document, can't find it |
| No intelligent + secure option | Current secure tools are dumb storage |

### Motivations

- Own and control their personal data
- Verify security claims (not just trust marketing)
- Simplify without sacrificing privacy
- Future-proof their digital life
- Professional organization for taxes, contracts, records

### Messaging That Works

- "Zero-knowledge encryption—we can't read your documents"
- "Your encryption keys never leave your device"
- "Open about what we collect and why"
- "Smart organization without compromising privacy"
- "Private AND smart. You shouldn't have to choose."

### Writing for Professionals

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Lead with privacy architecture | Lead with emotional family stories |
| Explain how it works | Hide behind "magic" |
| Emphasize ownership and control | Emphasize convenience only |
| Be specific about privacy claims | Make vague promises |
| Show transparency | Ask for blind trust |

**Technical depth:** Medium to high. They appreciate knowing *how* it works.

## Audience 3: High Net Worth Individuals

**Who:** Affluent individuals (45-70), $1M-$50M+ net worth, executives/entrepreneurs, married with adult children, complex financial lives, delegate to assistants.

**Entry point:** Estate organization, document consolidation, legacy planning

**The moment:**
> "Documents with my attorney, accountant, three advisors, two properties. My kids don't know where anything is."

### Pain Points

| Pain | Content Hook |
|------|--------------|
| Document sprawl | Documents scattered across multiple advisors |
| Estate complexity | Wills, trusts, POAs scattered and outdated |
| Family coordination | Adult children don't know where things are |
| Premium expectations | Current tools feel consumer-grade |
| Time scarcity | No time to organize, but need it done right |

### Motivations

- Consolidate complex financial and legal documents
- Ensure smooth estate transition
- Give family access without chaos
- Professional-grade organization
- Peace of mind about legacy

### Messaging That Works

- "Your complete estate, organized and accessible"
- "Ensure your legacy is in order"
- "Family access with the control you need"
- "Premium organization for complex lives"

### Writing for HNW

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Lead with estate/legacy | Lead with photo organization |
| Emphasize consolidation | Emphasize basic features |
| Premium, professional tone | Casual, consumer tone |
| Family coordination | Individual use cases |
| Complexity handled | Simplicity for its own sake |

**Technical depth:** Low to medium. They want results, not explanations.

## Jobs to Be Done

Use these as content hooks—they're the moments people seek MyVault:

### Life Events
> "When I experience a life event (new home, new baby, health scare), I want to organize my important documents so that my family is protected."

### Search Frustration
> "When I can't find an important document, I want to search across all my files so that I don't waste time or miss deadlines."

### Emergency Preparedness
> "When I worry about what would happen if I weren't here, I want my spouse to have access to everything so that they can handle things."

### Insurance Renewals
> "When I get an insurance renewal notice, I want to know if my coverage is still adequate so that I'm not overpaying or underprotected."

### Subscription Chaos
> "When I see another subscription charge I don't recognize, I want to see all my subscriptions in one place so that I can cut what I don't use."

### Estate Planning
> "When I think about my estate, I want all my documents consolidated so that my family isn't left searching."

### Privacy Concerns
> "When I read about another data breach, I want to know my documents are truly private so that I'm not dependent on big tech's promises."

- "Find any document in seconds"
- "Your data stays yours"
- "Organization that happens automatically"
- "Private by design"
