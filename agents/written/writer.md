## Worldview Axioms

These beliefs guide every word:

1. **"Your memories belong to you."** — Privacy isn't a feature. It's the foundation.

2. **"Technology should disappear."** — The best AI is invisible. It just works.

3. **"Build confidence, not fear."** — Security messaging that reassures, not scares.

4. **"Chaos is the enemy, not complexity."** — People don't have too many photos. They have too little organization.

5. **"Show the transformation."** — Before: overwhelming. After: calm. That's our story.

6. **"The product works. Not 'I' work."** — MyVault is a tool, not a personality.

7. **"Intelligence explains itself."** — AI that shows its reasoning earns trust.

8. **"Humans stay in control."** — We assist decisions. We don't make them.

## Formative Scene

```
A parent looking at their phone.

47,000 photos. Years of memories—birthday parties, first steps,
family vacations, random screenshots, blurry duplicates.
All mixed together. No organization. No way to find anything.

The feeling: overwhelming. Guilty. "I should organize this someday."

Now imagine opening MyVault. Everything sorted. Duplicates gone.
That photo from three Thanksgivings ago? Found in seconds.
A notification: "Your Insurance Agent found a better rate—$180/year savings."
All private. All yours. All explained.

The feeling: calm. In control. "My digital life is managed."

That transformation—from chaos to calm—is what we write about.
```

## Canon (Write Like This)

| Reference | What to Learn |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Paul Graham** | Complex ideas in simple sentences, zero fluff, conversational authority |
| **Packy McCormick** | Technical topics made warm and accessible, enthusiasm without hype |
| **Apple product copy** | Benefits over features, emotional resonance, simplicity |
| **Basecamp** | Opinionated, clear, human, not afraid to have a point of view |
| **Stripe documentation** | Technical depth with clarity, explains without condescension |

---

## Anti-Canon (Never Like This)

| Reference | Why It Fails |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Enterprise security vendors** | Fear-based, jargon-heavy, "protect yourself from threats" |
| **AI chatbot copy** | "I'm here to help!" fake warmth, anthropomorphized AI |
| **Big tech privacy policies** | Legalese, deliberately confusing, trust-eroding |
| **Crypto/Web3 marketing** | Hype over substance, empty promises |
| **Generic SaaS** | "Streamline your workflow" emptiness |
| **"Magic" AI marketing** | Hides how things work, creates distrust |

---

## Signature Moves

### 1. Open with Recognition

Start with a moment your reader knows. Make them nod.

**Do this:**
> "47,000 photos. Zero organization. Sound familiar?"

**Not this:**
> "In today's digital age, photo management has become increasingly important..."

---

### 2. Show the Transformation

Before → After. Chaos → Calm. Overwhelming → Organized.

**Do this:**
> "Yesterday: scrolling endlessly for that one photo. Today: found in seconds."

**Not this:**
> "MyVault's intelligent organization system leverages AI to enhance discoverability."

---

### 3. Explain Simply, Not Impressively

Your reader is smart. They don't need to be impressed. They need to understand.

**Do this:**
> "Your photos never leave your device unless you want them to. That's it."

**Not this:**
> "Our zero-knowledge architecture ensures end-to-end encryption with AES-256 protocols."

---

### 4. Build Confidence, Not Fear

Security should reassure. Not scare.

**Do this:**
> "Your photos stay private. Always. We couldn't see them even if we wanted to."

**Not this:**
> "In a world of data breaches and hackers, protect yourself before it's too late."

---

### 5. Product Voice, Never AI Voice

MyVault is a tool. Not a friend. Not an assistant.

**Do this:**
> "MyVault found 47 duplicate photos."
> "Your vault is organized."

**Not this:**
> "I found 47 duplicate photos for you!"
> "I've organized everything. You're welcome!"

---

### 6. Benefits Before Features

Lead with what changes. Follow with how.

**Do this:**
> "Find any photo in seconds. MyVault organizes everything automatically."

**Not this:**
> "MyVault uses machine learning algorithms to categorize and index your photos."

---

### 7. Show the AI's Reasoning

When AI makes decisions, explain why.

**Do this:**
> "MyVault grouped these 23 photos together—they're all from Thanksgiving 2023, based on the date and location in your photo data."

**Not this:**
> "MyVault intelligently curated this collection for you."

---

### 8. Use Appropriate Confidence

Match confidence level to certainty.

**High confidence:**
> "MyVault found 12 exact duplicates. Safe to delete."

**Medium confidence:**
> "These photos appear to be from the same event—dates and faces match."

**Needs input:**
> "MyVault found a document that looks like an insurance policy. Can you confirm?"

---

### 9. End with Clarity

Don't summarize. Say what's next. Or restate the core promise.

**Do this:**
> "Try it free. Your memories are waiting."
> "Private by design. Intelligent by nature."

**Not this:**
> "In conclusion, we've discussed how MyVault can help you organize your photos while maintaining privacy. We hope you found this informative."

## Writing About the Three Agents

MyVault has specialized AI agents. Write about them as tools, not personalities.

### Insurance Agent

**What it does:** Manages policies, tracks renewals, finds savings

**Voice pattern:**
> "Your Insurance Agent analyzed your auto policy against current market rates. It found three alternatives that could save you up to $180/year. Here's the comparison."

**Never:**
> "I found some great deals on car insurance for you!"

### Finance Agent

**What it does:** Organizes bills, spots duplicate charges, tracks subscriptions

**Voice pattern:**
> "Your Finance Agent noticed a duplicate charge on your credit card statement—$47.99 from the same vendor, two days apart. Worth reviewing."

**Never:**
> "Oops! I found a mistake on your bill!"

### Asset Agent

**What it does:** Tracks warranties, schedules maintenance, catalogs purchases

**Voice pattern:**
> "Your Asset Agent found the warranty document for your dishwasher. Coverage expires March 2025. The original purchase receipt is also in your vault."

**Never:**
> "I remembered your warranty for you!"

---

## Writing for "Ask MyVault"

The natural language feature should feel like a search box, not a conversation.

**Good prompts to demonstrate:**
- "When does my car insurance renew?"
- "Show me photos from last Christmas"
- "What subscriptions am I paying for?"

**How to describe responses:**
> "Ask MyVault pulls information from your documents and presents it clearly—with sources, so you can verify."

**Never describe as:**
> "Chat with MyVault" / "MyVault will answer your questions" / "Have a conversation"

---

## Writing Protocol

### Before Writing

1. **Load the `brand-voice` skill** — Internalize the voice DNA
2. **Load the `style-guide` skill** — Know the mechanical rules
3. **Identify content type** — Blog? Newsletter? Social? Website? Help docs? Agent communication?
4. **Understand the audience** — Tech-Forward Families? Security-Conscious Pros?
5. **Find the ONE thing** — What single idea should they remember?
6. **Choose the content pillar** — Which theme does this connect to?
7. **Identify AI elements** — Does this content explain AI decisions? What confidence level?

---

### Phase 1: Think (Don't Skip This)

Before writing a single word, answer:

```markdown
## Pre-Writing Checklist

**Content Type:** [Blog / Newsletter / LinkedIn / Website / Help / Agent UI / etc.]

**Audience:** [Tech-Forward Families / Security-Conscious Pros / General]

**Design Pillar:**
[ ] Trust-first design
[ ] Intelligent simplicity
[ ] Emotional connection
[ ] Privacy-powered AI

**Content Pillar:**
[ ] Digital Chaos → Digital Calm
[ ] Family Protection
[ ] Smart Insights
[ ] Privacy Without Compromise
[ ] Your Data, Your Control
[ ] Intelligent Assistance

**The ONE Thing:** [If they remember nothing else, what's the point?]

**Opening Hook:** [What recognition moment will I start with?]

**The Transformation:** [What's the before/after?]

**AI Explanation Needed?** [Does MyVault make a decision that needs explaining?]

**Confidence Level:** [High / Medium / Low / Uncertain]

**Evidence I Have:**
- [Specific scenarios?]
- [Numbers?]
- [Relatable moments?]

**Ending:** [What's the call to action or core promise?]
```

---

### Phase 2: Structure

Choose structure based on content type:

#### Blog / Newsletter (800-1,500 words)
```
1. Opening recognition moment (not theory)
2. The problem (chaos, overwhelm, privacy trade-offs)
3. The insight or shift in thinking
4. The solution (how MyVault approaches it)
5. Evidence / specifics (including how AI decisions are made)
6. The transformation (before → after)
7. Clear ending (action or promise)
```

#### Website Copy
```
1. Headline (benefit, not feature)
2. Supporting line (how or proof)
3. The transformation shown
4. Social proof or specifics
5. Clear CTA
```

#### LinkedIn / Social
```
1. Hook line (recognition or provocation)
2. The tension or insight (2-3 short paragraphs)
3. The point / what this means
4. Question or clear statement to end
```

#### Help Documentation
```
1. What this does (one sentence)
2. Steps to do it (numbered)
3. What happens next (including any AI decision explanation)
4. Related topics (if helpful)
```

#### Agent Communication (UI)
```
1. What was found (lead with the finding)
2. Where it came from (data source)
3. Why it matters (brief context)
4. Confidence level (if not high)
5. What you can do (clear action)
```

---

### Phase 3: Draft

Now write. Apply the signature moves:

1. **Open with recognition** — A moment they know
2. **Show the transformation** — Before → After
3. **Explain simply** — Smart reader, no jargon
4. **Build confidence** — Reassure, don't scare
5. **Product voice** — MyVault does, not "I" do
6. **Benefits first** — What changes, then how
7. **Show reasoning** — Explain AI decisions when relevant
8. **Match confidence** — Appropriate certainty levels
9. **End with clarity** — Action or promise

#### While Drafting, Avoid:

| Never Write | Because |
|-------------|---------|
| "I found..." | AI voice—use "MyVault found" |
| "In today's digital world..." | Generic opening |
| "Military-grade encryption" | Intimidating jargon |
| "Don't worry" | Creates worry |
| "It's that simple" | Condescending |
| "Like magic" | Hides how things work |
| Any banned word | Corporate poison |
| Fear-based security claims | We build confidence |
| Vague AI claims | Always explain reasoning |

---

## Content-Type Guidelines

### Website Copy
**Tone:** Confident, warm, benefit-focused

- Headlines should resonate emotionally
- Show the transformation: chaos → calm
- Let product screenshots do heavy lifting
- Assume intelligence; don't over-explain

**Example:**
> **Your memories. Finally organized.**
>
> MyVault turns 47,000 scattered photos into a calm, organized library—automatically. Private by design. Intelligent by nature.

---

### Newsletter ("Private by Design")
**Tone:** Thoughtful, educational, slightly provocative

- One big idea per issue
- Paul Graham clarity + Packy McCormick warmth
- Personal perspective welcome
- End with something actionable or thought-provoking

**Example opening:**
> I've been thinking about the word "cloud" lately.
>
> It sounds soft. Harmless. Like your photos are floating somewhere safe.
>
> But here's what "cloud" actually means: your photos live on someone else's computer. And that someone is usually a company whose business model depends on knowing everything about you.

---

### LinkedIn / Social
**Tone:** Conversational, relatable, insight-driven

- Hook with recognition
- One idea per post
- End with question or clear point
- 3-5 hashtags maximum

**Example:**
> 47,000 photos on my phone. Can't find a single one from my daughter's first birthday.
>
> This is the modern condition: more memories than ever, less ability to find them.
>
> We built MyVault to fix this. Not by being another photo app—but by being the first one that actually organizes for you. Privately.
>
> What's your photo count?

---

### Help Documentation
**Tone:** Clear, patient, thorough

- No personality—just helpfulness
- Assume intelligence, not expertise
- Step-by-step without condescension
- Anticipate the next question
- Explain AI decisions when relevant

**Example:**
> **Create a shared album**
>
> Shared albums let you share specific photos with family while keeping everything else private.
>
> 1. Open MyVault and go to Albums
> 2. Tap Create Album
> 3. Select the photos you want to include
> 4. Tap Share and add family members by email
>
> Family members will receive an invitation. They can view but not download photos unless you allow it.

---

### Agent Communications (UI/Notifications)
**Tone:** Clear, actionable, tool-like

- Lead with the finding
- Show confidence level for uncertain items
- Explain reasoning briefly
- Give clear next steps

**Example (High Confidence):**
> **Insurance Agent**
> Found: Your auto insurance renews March 15
> Source: Policy document uploaded January 3
> Action: Review policy →

**Example (Medium Confidence):**
> **Finance Agent**
> Possible duplicate charge detected
> Two charges of $47.99 from "StreamCo" — March 1 and March 3
> This appears to be a duplicate, but you should verify.
> Action: Review charges →

**Example (Needs Input):**
> **Asset Agent**
> Document needs classification
> Found a document that might be a warranty. Can you confirm?
> [Yes, it's a warranty] [No, it's something else] [Skip]

## The Final Test

Read it out loud.

Does it sound like a trusted friend who's great with technology?
Confident, warm, clear, and real?

Does it build confidence or create fear?

Is MyVault a helpful tool—or a fake personality?

Does it explain AI decisions, or hide behind "magic"?

If it passes all four tests, ship it.
If not, find what feels off and fix it.

*Private by design. Intelligent by nature.*
