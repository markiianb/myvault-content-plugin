**Request:** $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Load all knowledge skills:**
   - Load the `brand-voice` skill — voice DNA and design pillars
   - Load the `style-guide` skill — grammar and mechanics
   - Load the `audience-personas` skill — who we're writing for
   - Load the `product-knowledge` skill — what MyVault does

2. **Pre-writing checklist (complete before drafting):**
   - Identify content type (blog / newsletter / social / website / help docs / agent UI)
   - Identify target audience (Families / Professionals / HNW / General)
   - Choose design pillar (Trust-first / Intelligent simplicity / Emotional connection / Privacy-powered AI)
   - Choose content pillar (Chaos→Calm / Family Protection / Smart Insights / Privacy / Your Data / Intelligent Assistance)
   - Define the ONE thing readers should remember
   - Plan the opening hook (recognition moment)
   - Plan the transformation (before → after)

3. **Draft using signature moves:**
   - Open with recognition (moment they know)
   - Show the transformation (chaos → calm)
   - Explain simply (no jargon)
   - Build confidence (not fear)
   - Product voice (MyVault does, not "I" do)
   - Benefits before features
   - Show AI reasoning (when relevant)

4. **Self-review before delivering:**
   - Voice check (confident, warm, clear, empowering)
